  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>App:</strong> ShotWiz &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-12-31</p>

  <p>
    ShotWiz is a privacy-first screenshot organizer. This Privacy Policy explains what information is processed when you use
    the ShotWiz iOS app (the “App”), why it is processed, and the choices you have.
  </p>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Summary:</strong>
    ShotWiz does not require accounts and does not run a backend service. Screenshot scanning, categorization, and OCR are performed
    on your device. The free version may show ads via Google AdMob; subscribing to ShotWiz Pro removes ads.
  </div>

  <h2>1) Data Handling at a Glance (aligned to Apple’s App Privacy questions)</h2>
  <table class="table" aria-label="Apple App Privacy alignment">
    <tr>
      <th>Do we collect data?</th>
      <td>
        <strong>ShotWiz itself:</strong> No server-side collection. The app does not send your screenshots or OCR text to our servers.
        <br />
        <strong>Third parties:</strong> If ads are enabled, Google AdMob may collect certain device and usage information for ad delivery/measurement.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Is data linked to you?</th>
      <td>
        ShotWiz does not create user accounts. AdMob may use device identifiers for advertising/measurement. Whether that data is considered
        “linked” depends on Google’s processing and your device/ad settings.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Is data used to track you?</th>
      <td>
        ShotWiz does not track you.
        <br />
        AdMob may use data for advertising-related purposes. If you enable App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompts or ad personalization settings,
        your choices may affect ad behavior.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Does the app use sensitive data?</th>
      <td>
        ShotWiz may access your Photos library (screenshots) only to provide app functionality you request. Screenshots and OCR text remain on-device.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>2) Information the App Processes</h2>

  <h3>Photos / Screenshots</h3>
  <p>
    ShotWiz requests access to your Photos library only to identify and display screenshots, organize them into categories, run on-device OCR,
    and (if you choose) delete screenshots from Photos. ShotWiz does not upload your photos or screenshots to our servers.
  </p>

  <h3>On-Device OCR Text</h3>
  <p>
    When enabled by using the App, ShotWiz uses Apple’s on-device text recognition to extract text from screenshots so you can refine categories
    and search. OCR text is stored locally on your device. It is not transmitted to us.
  </p>

  <h3>App Data Stored Locally</h3>
  <p>
    ShotWiz stores certain metadata locally to provide core features, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Screenshot identifiers and timestamps</li>
    <li>Category assignments and user overrides</li>
    <li>Hidden/visible state and “viewed/new” status</li>
    <li>OCR text cache and internal scan/version metadata</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data remains on your device unless you delete it (for example, by deleting the app).
  </p>

  <h2>3) Advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
  <p>
    The free version of ShotWiz may display ads through <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. Google may collect and process information to provide and
    measure ads, which can include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device identifiers (e.g., advertising identifiers)</li>
    <li>Approximate location (derived from IP or device settings, depending on configuration)</li>
    <li>Ad interaction and performance data</li>
    <li>General app usage signals related to ad delivery</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This information is collected and processed by Google as described in Google’s policies:
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>ShotWiz Pro:</strong> If you subscribe to ShotWiz Pro, ads are removed.
  </p>

  <h2>4) In-App Purchases (Apple StoreKit)</h2>
  <p>
    ShotWiz offers an optional yearly subscription (“ShotWiz Pro”) to remove ads. Purchases are processed by Apple via the App Store.
    ShotWiz does not receive your payment details.
  </p>

  <h2>5) Data Not Collected by ShotWiz</h2>
  <p>
    ShotWiz does not operate a backend account system and does not directly collect:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your name, email, or account credentials (unless you email support)</li>
    <li>Your photos/screenshots or OCR text on our servers</li>
    <li>Precise location</li>
    <li>Contacts, calendars, or microphone data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) App Tracking Transparency (ATT) and “Tracking”</h2>
  <p>
    ShotWiz does not track users. Advertising SDKs may, depending on configuration and your settings, use device identifiers for ad measurement
    or personalization. If ATT is presented in the app, you can choose whether to allow tracking.
  </p>

  <h2>7) Your Choices and Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photos access:</strong> You can grant, limit, or revoke access in iOS Settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete data:</strong> Deleting the app removes ShotWiz’s locally stored app data.</li>
    <li><strong>Remove ads:</strong> Subscribe to ShotWiz Pro to remove ads.</li>
    <li><strong>Ad personalization:</strong> You can manage ad-related settings through your device and Google settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8) Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    ShotWiz is not designed to knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have received personal information
    from a child under 13, please contact us so we can address it.
  </p>

  <h2>9) Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top indicates when it was most recently revised.
  </p>

  <h2>10) Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, contact:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email:</strong> youremail@example.com</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <div class="note">
    <strong>For App Store Connect (“App Privacy” questionnaire) consistency:</strong>
    your in-app privacy answers should match your actual AdMob configuration. AdMob can involve device identifiers and usage data for advertising/measurement.
    If you later disable personalized ads or tracking-related features, you may be able to reduce what you declare in the questionnaire.
